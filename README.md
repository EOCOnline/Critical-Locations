# Critical-Locations#

For small communities, there are a limited number of establishments that are 'critical' to the community, or at least to fire and police and other life-safety organizations. This DNN Module will allow tracking their status and reporting that to others.

Note that this is intended to ONLY track physical locations and NOT for functionality - like whether the Internet is up or other communication functionality. Those are better served by the upcoming Critical Elements of Information module.
